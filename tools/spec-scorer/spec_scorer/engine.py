"""Scoring engine — pure mechanism, one entry point.

`score(artifact, contract) -> ScoreCard` mirrors `lint(artifact, contract)` and
`judge(artifact, contract, panel)`. The engine has ZERO knowledge of what any
dimension means: the contract parses and measures, the engine only sequences the
passes and stamps provenance.

Determinism: given the same artifact, contract, and (optional) verdict, the
*dimensions* are byte-identical across runs — there is no network, no model call,
no randomness anywhere on this path. The only non-deterministic field is
`measured_at`, which is provenance, not a score; inject `now` to pin it (the
determinism test does exactly that).

The Judger tier is passed alongside the verdict rather than read from it: a
`Verdict` does not carry its tier, and that tier is exactly the metadata a
consumer needs to decide whether two ScoreCards are comparable. Making the
caller supply it keeps that fact explicit instead of silently absent.
