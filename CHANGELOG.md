# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentSpec will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.6.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- **`docs/reference/releasing.md`** — the maintainer-only release procedure: branch topology, the version single-source rule, the step-by-step for cutting a release from a `release/X.Y.Z` branch, the hotfix back-merge requirement, and the full doctrine `scripts/bump.sh --check` enforces. Linked from `docs/README.md`.
- **Bump gate extended to documentation surfaces and `CHANGELOG.md`** (#85) — when a PR carries a shipped change (`plugin/` or `.claude-plugin/`), `scripts/bump.sh --check` now also asserts the README version badge, both `CLAUDE.md` version statements, and the `SECURITY.md` supported-versions row all state the canonical version, and that `CHANGELOG.md` carries a matching `## [X.Y.Z]` section. Surfaces are declared as data in a new `_surface_rows` table, so adding one is a single row; the check is skipped when nothing shipped changes, so a docs-only PR isn't blocked by pre-existing drift.
- **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release.md`** — opt-in checklist for release PRs (applied via `?template=release.md`) that points at `docs/reference/releasing.md` rather than restating it.
- **Trust layer V0 for the built plugin** (#84) — new `scripts/generate_manifest.py`, `sign_manifest.sh`, `verify_manifest.py`, and `verify_signature.sh` implement a hash → sign → distribute → verify chain of trust via cosign Sigstore keyless signing; the signed manifest and bundle ship under `plugin-extras/security/` alongside the built payload.
- **Spec-driven agent creation pipeline (Layer 1 of `feat/spec-schemas`, #71; ADR-006, #67)** — `agent.schema.md` defines the spec format for agents (spec-only fields `intent`/`success_criteria`/`acceptance_tests`/`overlap_check`/`trigger_count`, plus the cube→square field mapping onto `agent.md`); `_template.md` gains a machine-readable `tier_requirements` frontmatter block (T1/T2/T3 line ranges + required sections) and drops the prose `BEFORE CREATING` comment in favor of it; new `agent-architect` agent generates `agent.md` from a filled spec (generation only — Gate A/B enforcement is out of scope for this agent, left to `tools/spec-linter/` against the schema's documented contract). In-progress specs live under `.claude/sdd/specs/agents/`.
- **Artifact scoring layer — the Scorer (ADR-011, #88; PR #89)** — deterministic, multi-dimensional artifact scoring tool under `tools/spec-scorer/`, the reference implementation for ADR-011. Status: prototype — not yet packaged into the plugin; packaging stays gated on ADR-011 acceptance.
- **`github-review-pr` skill (repo-local)** — the repository's pull-request review protocol: ground the review in the issue or ADR the change implements before judging it, reproduce every claim by running the suites at the pull-request head in a throwaway worktree, and synthesize one comment that opens with an explicit verdict and numbers its items continuously across rounds. It produces comment text for a human to post and never approves. Lives in `.claude/skills/`, excluded from the distributed plugin via `REPO_LOCAL_SKILLS`.

### Changed

- **`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is now the sole version source** (#78) — `version` removed from `plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and the generated root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Claude Code already resolves a plugin's version `plugin.json` → marketplace entry → git commit SHA, so the marketplace copies carried no authority, only a drift risk; the gate (`check_manifest_version`, formerly `check_manifests_agree`) now rejects either manifest declaring a version instead of merely requiring the three to match.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the two-branch topology** (#86) — contributors are directed to branch from and open PRs against `develop`, never `main`; a new "Do not change the version" section states the one version rule a contributor can trip, "How a release happens" states where the version does move, and maintainers are pointed at `docs/reference/releasing.md`.
- **Releases are cut from a `release/X.Y.Z` branch** — the version is raised on a branch cut from `develop`; the release PR goes from that branch into `main` and merges with a merge commit; `main` is merged back into `develop` immediately afterwards. `develop` never carries a bump: raising the version there fails every open PR against `develop` at once. `docs/reference/releasing.md`, the release PR template, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the gate's own messages describe this flow.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`'s `[3.5.0]` date corrected** from 2026-07-19 to 2026-07-30, the day that release was actually cut.

### Fixed

- **`build-plugin.sh` no longer copies `tools/spec-judge/uv.lock` into the built plugin** — every build left it behind as an untracked file, so a build could never come back clean; the lockfile is a development artifact with no consumer in the shipped tree.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Marketplace install path now works end-to-end** (#18) — `claude plugin marketplace add luanmorenommaciel/agentspec` previously returned HTTP 404 because the resolver fetches `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from the repository root, but the manifest only existed under `plugin/.claude-plugin/`:
  - Added root-level `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `source: "./plugin"` pointing at the canonical built artifact
  - Added `build-plugin.sh` Step 5c that auto-regenerates the root manifest from `plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` on every build, preventing drift between the two locations
  - Verified: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luanmorenommaciel/agentspec/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now returns HTTP 200
- **`plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` schema fixed** (#17) — moved `description` into `metadata.description` to conform to the marketplace schema; the previous root-level `description` would have blocked publishing.
- **Count reconciliation across all current-state documentation** (#17, #18) — filesystem had 24 KB domains and 31 commands while documentation still said 23 / 30 in many places. Synchronized `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugin/README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/reference/README.md`, `docs/getting-started/README.md`, `docs/concepts/README.md`, `.claude/agents/README.md`, `.claude/commands/README.md`, `.claude/kb/README.md`, `.claude/kb/_index.yaml`, `.claude/sdd/README.md`, `.claude/sdd/_index.md` (mirrored into `plugin/sdd/` by the build), and `SECURITY.md` (supported version bumped to 3.2.x). Historical `version_history` rows for v2.1.0 / v3.0.0 preserved as audit trail.
- **`build-plugin.sh:272` KB counter** (#17) — the `! -name "shared"` exclusion under-reported KB domains by one. `shared/` contains anti-patterns referenced by every agent and is correctly counted as a domain now.

### Added

- **Component model persisted and wired (PR #65)** — `kb/shared/component-model.md` is the canonical definition of the four layers (agents EXECUTE, skills teach HOW, commands are ENTRYPOINTS, KBs are SOURCE-OF-TRUTH) plus the thin-executor pattern and the fat-to-thin refactor recipe. Operationalized by the new `component-model` skill (layer decision + routing to the authoring resources) and referenced from CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/concepts, the agent template, and the authoring skills.
- **SDD components restructured on the component model — 6 per-phase skills** (`sdd-brainstorm`, `sdd-define`, `sdd-design`, `sdd-build`, `sdd-ship`, `sdd-iterate`): each phase's methodology moved out of its agent and command into a dedicated skill; the phase agents are now thin executors (identity, non-negotiable policies, escalation, "read the skill and execute") and the phase commands thin entrypoints (argument surface + command-only concerns such as `--judge`). Agent frontmatter is byte-identical, so the auto-generated router is unchanged. `sdd-workflow` moved from plugin-extras into `.claude/skills/` as the umbrella that indexes the per-phase skills.
- **`create-agent` skill (repo-local)** — this repository's SOP for adding an agent: the frontmatter contract (which fields feed the router), thin-executor default, router regeneration, and ship checklist.
- **`/create-kb` is now the single KB entrypoint with two modes** — default light single-pass (kb-architect) and `--validated` routing to the `kb-build` skill (research, adversarial verification, independent fact-check gate); `--audit` unchanged. `kb-build` reframed as the capability behind the flag rather than a sibling door.

- **Workflow skills suite — 4 new distributed skills** (plugin: 5 → 9): `github-cr-adr`, `github-cr-issue`, and `github-post-issue` form a draft → guarded-publish lifecycle for ADRs and issues (pre-draft dedup, self-containment lint, `gh auth status` pre-flight before writes, live label validation with human-in-the-loop creation, native sub-issue relationships, close-never-delete curation, and sequential ADR numbers allocated mechanically from the live board at publish time); `kb-build` builds high-assurance, source-verified KB domains with adversarial verification. Drafts are ephemeral pipeline artifacts under `.claude/sdd/drafts/` — created by `github-cr-*`, consumed and deleted by `github-post-issue` after successful publish, mirroring the ephemeral-spec lifecycle.
- **Repo-local skill tier** — `build-plugin.sh` gains a `REPO_LOCAL_SKILLS` exclusion step for skills that support contributors working in this repository without shipping to plugin consumers. First three: `create-skill` (this repository's conventions for adding a skill — naming, placement tiers, frontmatter pitfalls, ship checklist — deferring general skill-writing craft to the upstream `skill-creator`, fetched from its public repository when not installed locally), `meeting-analysis` (transcript → validated analysis document via `meeting-analyst` + channel-ready follow-up), and `standup-report` (daily Done / Will do / Blockers message from git and GitHub state).
- **`supabase` KB domain** — pgvector, RLS, Edge Functions, Auth, Realtime, migrations. Consumed by `supabase-specialist`. Brings total to 24 KB domains.
- **`shared` KB domain entry** — `.claude/kb/shared/anti-patterns.md` is now formally cataloged in `.claude/kb/README.md` as a cross-domain resource referenced by every agent via `anti_pattern_refs`.
- **Contract Enforcement layer — the Linter (ADR-002, #54; shipped in PR #55)** — a deterministic contract-validation engine that checks an artifact against a contract and returns a `PASS`/`WARN`/`FAIL` verdict. The engine is pure mechanism (`lint(artifact, contract)`); contracts are policy (three sources: authored-as-code reference contract, data-driven SDD-phase contract, instance-derived contract); consumers declare their own binding. New `contract_enforcement` block in `WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml` (version bumped 3.2.0 → 3.3.0), Quality Gates in `ARCHITECTURE.md` now reference the component, and `contract_enforcement.consumer_bindings` declares each phase's pre-handoff document-validation binding against its phase contract (`required_sections`). Operator usage documented in `tools/spec-linter/USAGE.md`. Component lives under `tools/spec-linter/` with its own CI job. Phase-spec "Gate A" two-pass validation is the specified target, activating when upstream canonical phase-spec schemas land.
- **Three-way exit-code contract for the Linter** — the CLI now separates an operational ERROR from a verdict: exit `0` = PASS or WARN, exit `1` = FAIL, exit `2` = ERROR (missing file, YAML syntax error, non-mapping top level, unknown phase, a phase without `required_sections`, or missing dependencies). ERROR is a process concern, not a fourth Verdict Level — the verdict surface stays exactly PASS/WARN/FAIL. Documented in `tools/spec-linter/USAGE.md` and the `exit_code_contract` block in `WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml` (version bumped 3.3.0 → 3.3.1).
- **Deterministic `spec-lint` wrapper** — `tools/spec-linter/spec-lint` resolves a working interpreter (honors `$SPEC_LINTER_PYTHON`, then a local `.venv`, then ambient `python3`/`python`) that can import `pydantic` and `pyyaml`. If none can, it prints `ERROR: spec-linter unavailable …` and exits `2` LOUDLY rather than silently passing the contract check.
- **`--phase NAME` CLI path** — lints a Markdown phase document against an `SddPhaseContract` whose `required_sections` are sourced from a `--contracts-file` (default `.claude/sdd/architecture/WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml`); each required section must appear as a heading or the verdict is FAIL.
- **Linter packaged into the plugin** — `build-plugin.sh` now copies `tools/spec-linter/` into `plugin/tools/spec-linter/` (excluding `.venv`, `tests/`, and caches), rewrites `tools/spec-linter/` references to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/spec-linter/`, and restores the wrapper's executable bit, so the phase-document checks can run inside an installed plugin.
- **Loud-degrading consumer bindings on the phase document check** — the Define and Design phases now run the `spec-lint` wrapper against the document they produce and branch on the exit code (0 proceed, 1 block-and-fix, 2 record a VISIBLE `⚠️ contract check skipped` note and proceed — never an assumed PASS); Iterate does the same against the phase of the document it edited. Only Define and Design have `required_sections` today, so Brainstorm, Build, and Ship carry no document-level check until a phase contract is added for them.
- **Behavioral Evaluation layer — the Judger (ADR-003, PR #64)** — a model-based, contract-aware evaluation engine that runs after the Linter passes (never on a structural FAIL). New `behavioral_enforcement` block in `WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml` (version bumped 3.4.0 → 3.5.0) documents verdict semantics (PASS/WARN/FAIL, the same tokens as the Linter — consumers must not reinterpret FAIL), the four B1–B4 finding categories (vagueness, capability not delivered, internal contradiction, intent drift), and three independence tiers: smoke (one fault-seeker, WARN ceiling), standard (fault-seeker + conformance-checker + arbiter, WARN ceiling, default), and high-assurance (adds a cross-model fault-seeker; FAIL is reachable only under a strict three-way same-platform-plus-cross-model-plus-arbiter consensus at confidence ≥ 0.7). Mirrors the Linter's shape (`judge(artifact, contract, panel=None)`) and reuses its `Verdict`/`Finding` value objects. Five-way exit-code contract — 0 PASS/WARN, 1 FAIL, 2 ERROR, 3 BUDGET, 4 NETWORK — where codes ≥ 2 are "couldn't-run" states, never a verdict. A shared, append-only per-day ledger (`.claude/storage/judge-ledger.jsonl`) caps spend across the judge family; `spec-judge --selfcheck` verifies the sibling Linter resolves without spending budget. Component lives under `tools/spec-judge/`, packaged into the plugin by `build-plugin.sh` alongside the Linter (same copy-then-prune shape; the two ship side by side because the Judger imports the Linter's value objects via the wrapper's `PYTHONPATH`). Operator documentation: `tools/spec-judge/USAGE.md`. Status: prototype — the specified consumer bindings (post-generation review at the standard tier, pre-release/publish at the high-assurance tier) are a specified TARGET, not yet wired into the generation lifecycle.
- **`spec-lint` reads self-contained `.md` agent files (#77)** — a `.md` file is now a first-class spec-linting input: its leading YAML frontmatter block IS the spec, extracted and linted against the agent-spec contract exactly as a `.yaml` file's mapping would be (same contract, same verdicts, same exit codes). A `.md` file with no frontmatter block, or a frontmatter block that isn't valid YAML or isn't a mapping, is an operational ERROR (exit 2) — loud, never a silent pass. The directory walk (e.g. `spec-lint plugin/agents`) now selects `.yaml`, `.yml`, AND `.md` files, recursing into subdirectories so a full category tree lints as one fleet in a single run; `README.md` and any `_`-prefixed file are excluded and reported once in a single `skipped (non-spec): ...` line rather than silently dropped. The cross-file duplicate-id (L4) check now spans YAML and Markdown sources alike.
- **Version-bump gate and deterministic end-to-end workflows (#76)** — `scripts/bump.sh --check` enforces that a shipped change (`plugin/` + `.claude-plugin/`) carries a version strictly greater than `origin/main`'s when a PR targets `main`, and that the version stays equal to `origin/main`'s when a PR targets `develop` (develop never carries a bump itself — a release PR, develop → main, is what advances the version). It also verifies all three version manifests (`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) agree before checking either doctrine. `--check` only — bumps are still applied by hand in the release PR. New `.github/workflows/bump-gate.yml` runs it on every PR to `main`/`develop`, waived by a (currently dormant) `no-release` label. New `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` adds two jobs with zero LLM/API calls: `install-runtime` performs a full headless marketplace-add + plugin-install in a sandboxed `HOME`, asserts the registry parses and that agent/skill/command counts match between source and the installed copy, and exercises the Linter's and Judger's exit-code contracts (0/1/2, and `--selfcheck`) against the INSTALLED copy without a `--contracts-file` override — resolving the phase contract from the installed layout is exactly the regression it guards; `fleet-lint` is a report-only burn-down counter that runs the Linter across the full agent fleet and publishes `FLEET-LINT: N/TOTAL files failing agent-spec contract` to the job summary (currently 58/58 — see Follow-ups).

### Changed

- **WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml 3.4.0** — phase blocks now carry a `skill:` reference and keep only contract-grade facts (inputs, outputs, status values, quality gates, thresholds); methodology sub-blocks moved into the per-phase skills. Removed the duplicated per-phase agent `model`/`tools` (and the overview `model:` fields) — agent frontmatter is authoritative and the duplicated copies had drifted (4 of 6 models wrong; build-agent's tools list omitted `Task`). The stale model tables in `sdd/_index.md` and `sdd/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` were replaced with pointers to the authoritative sources for the same reason; `kb-architect`'s hardcoded line limits now defer to `_index.yaml`.
- **Contract gate relocated from the phase agents to the phase skills** — the pre-handoff contract check now lives in `sdd-define`, `sdd-design`, and `sdd-iterate` alongside each phase's other quality-gate obligations, matching the component model (agents execute; skills own the procedure). Each skill names the artifact and the `--phase` to validate and defers to `tools/spec-linter/USAGE.md` for the exit-code contract and verdict semantics rather than restating them; `contract_enforcement.consumer_bindings` in `WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml` remains the single place a binding is declared. The Brainstorm/Build/Ship gate stubs were dropped rather than moved: they narrated the absence of a `required_sections` key that the contract file already owns and the linter already reports itself (exit 2 — record a visible skip and proceed).
- **Linter value objects are frozen** — `Finding`, `Verdict`, and the `AgentSpec` model are immutable, so a verdict cannot be mutated after assembly (covered by `tools/spec-linter/tests/test_immutability.py`).
- **Linter `parse()` aligned to the Contract protocol** — each contract's `parse(artifact)` turns a raw artifact into a checkable object (or raises to signal an unparseable artifact, which the engine reports as a single `<contract>.unparseable` FAIL), keeping the engine free of any artifact-shape knowledge.
- **Phase 3 build is now fully autonomous — decide, never ask** (#20) — `/build` no longer pauses mid-build to ask the user when it hits an ambiguous decision fork. The build-agent now picks the option most consistent with the DESIGN, `.claude/kb/` patterns, and the "smallest correct change" principle, then proceeds without interruption. Every autonomous choice is recorded in the new `## Autonomous Decisions` table in the BUILD_REPORT for post-run audit. The only stop conditions are a CRITICAL risk (secrets, irreversible deploy, data loss) or a build that genuinely cannot complete after retries — both logged as blockers, never raised as questions. Updated `.claude/agents/workflow/build-agent.md`, `.claude/commands/workflow/build.md`, and `.claude/sdd/templates/BUILD_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` (mirrored into `plugin/` by the build).
- `plugin/README.md` — "Auto-Invoked Skills" count corrected from 4 to 5 (added `agent-router` to the list); domain list now enumerates all 24 domains including Supabase and shared anti-patterns.
- **Version surfaces aligned with 3.5.0** — the README version badge, the CLAUDE.md status and version blocks, and the SECURITY.md supported-versions table now state 3.5.0/3.5.x alongside the three plugin manifests, so the announced version matches the shipped one.

### Follow-ups

- **Reliable in-plugin linter execution** — the bundled linter currently relies on the host having `python3` with `pydantic` and `pyyaml` (or a local `.venv`); when absent, the consumer bindings degrade loudly (exit 2, visible skip). A tracked follow-up will make the linter provision its own dependencies inside an installed plugin — either `uv run` with PEP 723 inline deps, or a stdlib-only linter — so the contract check runs reliably in-plugin without a preprovisioned environment.
- **Fleet-lint burn-down** — the `fleet-lint` CI job (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) is report-only by design: today it reports 58/58 agent files failing the reference agent-spec contract (the reference contract's canonical schema is still owned upstream — see the Linter's "Status & scope" note). It flips to a blocking check once the count reaches zero (issue #79).

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Local-first agent overrides** — users can now drop a file in `.claude/agents/<category>/<name>.md` to override any of the 58 plugin agents without forking:
  - SessionStart hook (`init-workspace.sh`) scaffolds `.claude/agents/{workflow,custom}/` on first run
  - Auto-generated `.claude/agents/README.md` documents the override pattern with worked examples (preserves user edits across runs)
  - New `agent_resolution` contract in `.claude/sdd/architecture/WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml` documents precedence (`local` → `plugin`)
  - New concept doc at `docs/concepts/agent-overrides.md` with full pattern reference
  - "Customizing Agents" section added to `docs/getting-started/README.md`
  - Override callout added to root `README.md` Install section
  - Resolution itself is provided by Claude Code's native plugin loader — AgentSpec adds discovery and documentation, not a parallel resolver
- **`--judge` flag on `/define`, `/design`, `/build`** — progressive-enhancement integration of Judge V0 into the SDD workflow:
  - `/define FEATURE --judge` → cross-model spec-quality review (default: openai/gpt-4o)
  - `/design FEATURE --judge` → architectural-soundness review (default: openai/gpt-4o)
  - `/build FEATURE --judge` → BUILD_REPORT correctness review (default: openai/gpt-4o; consider openai/codex-mini for pure-code builds)
  - Three modes per command: advisory (`--judge`), gated (`--judge=strict`), model-override (`--judge=MODEL` or `--judge=strict:MODEL`)
  - Phase-aware system prompts in `scripts/judge.py` tuned to each artifact type (DEFINE for requirements, DESIGN for architecture, BUILD for code)
  - Defaults preserved — running the commands without `--judge` behaves identically to v3.1.0
  - Budget exhaustion, config errors, and network errors never block the phase — judge failures degrade to "as if `--judge` was not passed"
- **Stale-count syncs** (from Audit 3): CLAUDE.md, commands/README.md, docs/reference/README.md, and root README.md now consistently reflect 58 agents / 31 commands / 3 skills / 23 KB domains / v3.1.0 current status
- `/status` added to Core Commands table in `.claude/commands/README.md` (was missing since v3.1.0)
- `/judge` added to Review Commands table in `.claude/commands/README.md`
- **`Makefile`** as the primary contributor entry point — one-line access to build, test, check, lint, generate, clean. `make help` lists all targets with descriptions.
- **`.shellcheckrc`** at repo root — `shell=bash`, disables SC1091/SC2155 (noisy for our repo). Used by both local `make lint` and CI.
- **`.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`** — new GitHub Actions workflow split into two jobs:
  - `python`: pytest suite + `generate-agent-router.py --check` drift guard
  - `shellcheck`: shellcheck -S warning on all three first-party shell scripts
- **`init-workspace.sh` mandatory header block** (audit-tier-3): shebang, Prerequisites, Usage sections, `--help` flag
- **Agent Router v2 — Phase 1 (Build-Time Generation)** — the `agent-router` skill is now auto-generated from agent frontmatter, eliminating hand-maintained routing tables:
  - `scripts/generate-agent-router.py` — parses frontmatter across all 58 agents and derives category/tier/model/kb_domains/escalations without any new frontmatter fields required
  - Generates both `.claude/skills/agent-router/SKILL.md` (human-readable) and `.claude/skills/agent-router/routing.json` (machine-readable, foundation for future semantic layer)
  - `--check` mode for CI: fails with a unified diff if on-disk output drifts from generated content
  - Content hash stamped in SKILL.md (currently `d2970b1b988f`) for drift detection
  - `DO NOT EDIT` header pointing contributors back to the script
- `scripts/` directory at repo root for build tooling (distinct from `plugin-extras/scripts/` which ships in the plugin)
- **Judge Layer V0** — opt-in cross-model second opinion via OpenRouter:
  - New `/judge <file>` slash command at `.claude/commands/review/judge.md`
  - `scripts/judge.py` — calls OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible API with zero SDK dependencies (pure stdlib `urllib`)
  - Default model `openai/gpt-4o-mini`; overridable via `JUDGE_MODEL` env or `--model` flag
  - Hard per-day budget ceiling (default 10 calls, overridable via `JUDGE_BUDGET`) enforced by append-only ledger at `.claude/storage/judge-ledger.jsonl`
  - Structured JSON verdict rendered as markdown: PASS/FAIL, confidence 0-1, severity-ranked concerns with evidence citations, suggested fixes
  - Distinct exit codes (0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 config, 3 budget, 4 API) for future CI/shell composition
  - `/judge --ledger` shows today's usage
  - Setup guide at `docs/getting-started/judge-setup.md` covering OpenRouter key, cost reference, privacy, troubleshooting
  - No MCP server, no auto-triggering hook, no classifier in V0 — user opts in per invocation
- **Flag System (Progressive Enhancement Framework)** added to backlog as 🔵 P1 for v3.2 — unified flag vocabulary across all phase commands, preserving AgentSpec's simple surface while enabling opt-in depth

### Changed

- `build-plugin.sh` gained **Step 0** — runs the agent-router generator before copying artifacts into `plugin/`, ensuring the plugin ships the current routing tables
- `CLAUDE.md` repository tree updated to reflect the new `scripts/` directory
- `tasks/backlog.md` marks Agent Router v2 Phase 1 as 🟢 shipped and tracks Phases 2-4 as future work

### Fixed

- Broken link in `.claude/commands/README.md`: `[data-engineering/README.md](data-engineering/README.md)` → `[data-engineering/](data-engineering/)` (referenced file didn't exist; directory does)
- **PySpark detection in `init-workspace.sh`** now also checks `requirements.txt` (previously only checked `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`, which missed common Python project layouts)
- **Version drift** — `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, README badge, and WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml now all consistently report `3.2.0`

### Philosophy

Adding, renaming, or retiring an agent no longer requires editing the router. Edit the agent's frontmatter → run `./build-plugin.sh` (or the generator standalone) → routing updates itself.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **New skill: `agent-router`** — intelligent routing table that maps file patterns, intent keywords, and domain context to all 58 agents. Includes model cost optimization strategy (Haiku 70% / Sonnet 20% / Opus 10%) and serial/parallel composition hints
- **New command: `/status`** — comprehensive project status report scanning SDD workspace, git state, codebase health (tests, TODOs, docs), and generating actionable recommendations with suggested next commands
- **Stack auto-detection in `init-workspace.sh`** — SessionStart hook now detects 10+ technology stacks (dbt, Lakeflow, Lambda, Airflow, Supabase, Terraform, Spark, Streaming, Fabric, Data Quality) and generates `.detected-stack.md` with recommended KB domains, agents, and commands
- **New KB domain: `supabase/`** — dedicated knowledge base with 4 concepts (pgvector-fundamentals, rls-policies, edge-functions, realtime) and 3 patterns (rag-vector-store, multi-tenant-rls, webhook-edge-function)
- New KB concepts for `lakeflow/`: expectations-model, cdc-fundamentals, deployment-model (now 5 concepts, within 3-6 spec)
- New KB file: `aws/quick-reference.md` — consolidated Lambda + Deployment cheat sheet
- New file: `commands/visual-explainer/README.md` — documents all 8 visual-explainer commands
- Plugin-only skills (`sdd-workflow`, `data-engineering-guide`) documented in `docs/reference/README.md`
- Vercel CLI prerequisite note in `/share` command

### Fixed

- **Critical:** 4 agents referenced non-existent KB domains in body text — `supabase-specialist` (supabase/), `qdrant-specialist` (qdrant/, n8n/), `ci-cd-specialist` (devops/), `ai-prompt-specialist-gcp` (gemini/, langfuse/) — all remapped to existing domains
- **Critical:** `lakeflow-expert` dead reference to `08-operations/limitations.md` → corrected to `reference/limitations.md`
- Dead `README.md` reference in `excalidraw-diagram/SKILL.md` — replaced with inline setup pointer
- Dead `./commands/` references in `visual-explainer/SKILL.md` — corrected to `.claude/commands/visual-explainer/`
- Malformed `mcp_servers` frontmatter in `llm-specialist.md` — reformatted to proper YAML objects with `tools:` field
- Missing `tools:` field in `mcp_servers` for 3 lakeflow T3 agents (lakeflow-architect, lakeflow-pipeline-builder, lakeflow-expert)
- `spark-specialist` → `spark-engineer` in `docs/concepts/README.md` build delegation
- Code of Conduct entry in CHANGELOG v1.0.0 clarified as "referenced in CONTRIBUTING.md"
- `/share` command added to README Visual & Utilities table

### Changed

- Command count: 29 → 30 (added `/status`)
- Skill count: 3 in source / 5 in plugin (added `agent-router` to source; plugin adds `sdd-workflow`, `data-engineering-guide`)
- KB domain count: 22 → 23 (added `supabase/`) — updated across all docs, SDD files, agents README, CLAUDE.md, README.md, and WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml
- `WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml` version bumped from 2.1.0 → 3.0.0
- `_index.yaml` version bumped to 2.2, supabase domain registered
- `supabase-specialist` agent now uses dedicated `supabase/` KB domain instead of `ai-data-engineering/` (semantically correct)
- Skills section in `docs/reference/README.md` updated to "2 core + 2 plugin-only" with plugin-only skills documented
- Plugin rebuilt — 58 agents, 30 commands, 5 skills, 23 KB domains

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Claude Code Plugin support**: AgentSpec is now distributable as a proper Claude Code plugin
- Plugin manifest (`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) with marketplace metadata
- `build-plugin.sh` — build script that packages `.claude/` into plugin format with path rewriting
- `plugin-extras/` — plugin-only skills, hooks, and scripts not in `.claude/`
- New skill: `sdd-workflow` — auto-invoked when users discuss feature development workflow
- New skill: `data-engineering-guide` — auto-invoked when users discuss data engineering tasks
- `hooks/hooks.json` — SessionStart hook for workspace initialization
- `scripts/init-workspace.sh` — idempotent workspace directory creator
- Marketplace configuration for self-hosted distribution
- Plugin installation method in README alongside legacy `cp -r` method

### Changed

- All internal paths in plugin output rewritten from `.claude/` to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/`
- Skills count increased from 2 to 4 (added sdd-workflow, data-engineering-guide)
- Version bumped to 3.0.0 (new distribution model)

### Architecture

- `.claude/` remains the source of truth for development
- `build-plugin.sh` generates `plugin/` directory with proper plugin structure
- Plugin-only content lives in `plugin-extras/` to survive build clean cycles
- Workspace-specific paths (features/, reports/, archive/) preserved as project-relative

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Documentation for 8 visual-explainer commands (`/generate-web-diagram`, `/generate-slides`, `/generate-visual-plan`, `/diff-review`, `/plan-review`, `/project-recap`, `/fact-check`, `/share`)
- Documentation for skills system (2 skills: `visual-explainer`, `excalidraw-diagram`)
- Skills contribution guide in CONTRIBUTING.md

### Fixed

- Command count corrected from 21 to 29 across all documentation (CLAUDE.md, README, commands/README, docs/reference)
- Fixed `meeting-analyst` incorrectly listed in Architect category (belongs in Dev) in sdd/README.md and README.md; replaced with `kb-architect`
- Fixed "23 KB domains" typo in sdd/README.md version history (correct: 22)
- Removed orphan `lakeflow/_index.yaml` (only domain with its own index file; master `_index.yaml` already covers it)
