## Autonomous Decisions

The build phase runs autonomously — it never pauses to ask the user. Every
decision fork reached during the build was resolved by choosing the safest
documented default. This section is the post-run review log: each row is a
fork the build resolved on its own. An empty table means the build hit zero
ambiguity (DESIGN fully pre-decided everything).

| # | Decision Point | Options Considered | Chose | Rationale |
|---|----------------|--------------------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | {What was ambiguous} | {Option A vs Option B} | {Chosen option} | {Why it is the safest / smallest-correct-change default} |

---

## Deviations from Design

| Deviation | Reason | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| {What changed from DESIGN} | {Why it changed} | {Effect on system} |

## Blockers (if any)

| Blocker | Required Action | Owner |
