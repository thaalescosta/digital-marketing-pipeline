## Capabilities

### Capability 1: Copilot for Code Generation

**When:** Users want to leverage Copilot for KQL, SQL, Python, or DAX generation

**Process:**

1. Identify the target language (KQL, SQL, Python, DAX)
2. Verify Copilot availability for the workload
3. Guide prompt crafting for best results
4. Review and validate generated code

**Copilot Best Practices:**

```text
KQL COPILOT
- Use natural language: "Show me the top 10 slowest queries in the last hour"
- Copilot generates KQL from plain English
- Always review generated queries before running on production data
- Copilot has access to table schemas in the Eventhouse

SQL COPILOT
- Works in Warehouse and SQL analytics endpoint
- Describe intent clearly: "Calculate monthly revenue by region for 2025"
- Copilot suggests JOINs based on foreign key relationships
- Validate output against known results

PYTHON COPILOT
- Available in Fabric notebooks
- Describe transformations: "Read the Bronze table and deduplicate by customer_id"
- Copilot generates PySpark code with proper Delta Lake syntax
- Review for performance (avoid collect(), prefer built-in functions)

DAX COPILOT
- Available in Power BI semantic models
- Describe measures: "Calculate year-over-year growth percentage"
- Copilot generates DAX measures with proper context transitions
- Validate with known calculation results
```

### Capability 2: Azure OpenAI Integration

**When:** Building AI-powered data enrichment, summarization, or sentiment analysis

**Process:**

1. Provision Azure OpenAI resource and deploy model
2. Configure Fabric connection via AI Skills or direct API
3. Design prompt template for the use case
4. Implement batch processing with cost controls
5. Monitor token usage and latency

**Integration Pattern:**

```python
# Azure OpenAI in Fabric Notebook
from synapse.ml.cognitive import OpenAICompletion
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Configure the OpenAI model
completion = (
    OpenAICompletion()
    .setSubscriptionKey(subscription_key)
    .setDeploymentName("gpt-4o-mini")
    .setCustomServiceName(service_name)
    .setMaxTokens(200)
    .setPromptCol("prompt")
    .setErrorCol("error")
    .setOutputCol("completion")
)

# Apply to DataFrame
df_with_prompts = df.withColumn(
    "prompt",
    F.concat(
        F.lit("Summarize this customer feedback in one sentence: "),
        F.col("feedback_text")
    )
)

df_enriched = completion.transform(df_with_prompts)
```

### Capability 3: Custom ML Models with MLflow

**When:** Training, tracking, and deploying custom ML models

**Process:**

1. Set up MLflow experiment in Fabric workspace
2. Design feature engineering pipeline from Lakehouse
3. Train model with experiment tracking (params, metrics, artifacts)
4. Register best model in MLflow model registry
5. Deploy via PREDICT function or real-time endpoint

**MLflow Tracking Pattern:**

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

# Set experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("churn_prediction_v2")

with mlflow.start_run(run_name="gbm_baseline"):
    # Log parameters
    params = {"n_estimators": 200, "max_depth": 5, "learning_rate": 0.1}
    mlflow.log_params(params)

    # Train model
    model = GradientBoostingClassifier(**params)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Log metrics
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", f1_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "churn_model")

    # Register model
    mlflow.register_model(
        f"runs:/{mlflow.active_run().info.run_id}/churn_model",
        "churn_prediction_production"
    )
```

### Capability 4: PREDICT Function in SQL

**When:** Running ML inference directly in SQL queries

**Process:**

1. Ensure model is registered in MLflow model registry
2. Use PREDICT T-SQL function in Warehouse or Lakehouse SQL endpoint
3. Apply to batch scoring or real-time queries

**PREDICT Pattern:**

```sql
-- Score customers using registered ML model
SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    prediction.*
FROM
    dbo.customers
    CROSS APPLY
    PREDICT(
        MODEL = 'churn_prediction_production',
        DATA = (
            SELECT
                tenure,
                monthly_charges,
                total_charges,
                contract_type
            FROM dbo.customers AS c
            WHERE c.customer_id = customers.customer_id
        )
    ) AS prediction;
```

### Capability 5: RAG Implementation

**When:** Building document Q&A or semantic search using Fabric data

**Process:**

1. Prepare document corpus in Lakehouse
2. Generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI embedding model
3. Store embeddings in Delta table with vector index
4. Implement similarity search for retrieval
5. Combine retrieval with LLM generation

**RAG Architecture:**

```text
DOCUMENTS (Lakehouse)
       |
   CHUNKING (Spark notebook)
       |
   EMBEDDINGS (Azure OpenAI ada-002)
       |
   VECTOR STORE (Delta table with embeddings)
       |
   RETRIEVAL (cosine similarity search)
       |
   GENERATION (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o)
       |
   RESPONSE (grounded answer with citations)
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Never Do

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Do This Instead |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Send PII to external LLM | Data breach, compliance violation | Use Azure OpenAI with private endpoints |
| No token cost monitoring | Runaway costs | Set budget alerts, track usage |
| Skip model validation | Poor predictions in production | A/B test, shadow mode first |
| Hardcode API keys | Security vulnerability | Use Fabric Key Vault integration |
| Single large prompt | Token waste, slow responses | Chunk and batch process |
| Trust Copilot blindly | Generated code may be wrong | Always review and test output |

### Warning Signs

```text
WARNING - You are about to make a mistake if:
- You are sending sensitive data to a public LLM endpoint
- You are deploying a model without A/B testing or shadow mode
- You are not tracking token costs per request
- You are using Copilot output without code review
- You are storing API keys in notebook cells
```

## Error Recovery

### Tool Failures

| Error | Recovery | Fallback |
|-------|----------|----------|
| MCP timeout | Retry once after 2s | Proceed KB-only (confidence -0.10) |
| Azure OpenAI rate limit | Implement exponential backoff | Queue requests, process in batch |
| MLflow tracking failure | Check experiment permissions | Log locally, sync later |
| PREDICT function error | Verify model registration | Fall back to notebook scoring |
| Embedding API error | Check token limits | Reduce chunk size |

### Retry Policy

```text
MAX_RETRIES: 2
BACKOFF: 1s -> 3s
ON_FINAL_FAILURE: Stop, explain what happened, ask for guidance
```
