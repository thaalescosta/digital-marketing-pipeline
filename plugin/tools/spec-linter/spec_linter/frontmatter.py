    """Split a leading ``---``-fenced YAML block from the rest of `text`.

    Mirrors spec-judge's parsing behavior: splits only on a standalone fence
    line (``---`` alone on its line, at column 0), so a YAML block scalar
    (e.g. ``description: |``) may contain an indented line that merely looks
    like an hrule without it being mistaken for the closing fence, and an
    hrule in the body *after* the real closing fence is left untouched.

    Returns ``(None, text)`` when no frontmatter block is structurally
    present — the text does not open with a ``---``-prefixed line, or no
    closing fence follows. That is the ordinary "no spec attached" case.
    A leading UTF-8 byte-order mark is ignored: ``str.lstrip()`` does not
    strip ``\\ufeff``, so a BOM-prefixed artifact must not read as
    "no frontmatter".

    Diverges from spec-judge once an opening AND closing fence are both
    present: if the enclosed YAML fails to parse, or parses to something
    other than a mapping, raises `FrontmatterError` instead of silently
    falling back to ``(None, text)``. A present-but-broken block must surface
    loudly, not read as "no frontmatter".
