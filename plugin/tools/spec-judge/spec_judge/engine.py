"""The engine — one entry point, pure orchestration.

``judge(artifact, contract, panel) -> Verdict`` mirrors the Linter's
``lint(artifact, contract) -> Verdict`` and returns the **same** ``Verdict`` type,
so a consumer handles both the structural and behavioral gates with one code path.

The engine has zero model vocabulary and zero I/O of its own: the contract parses,
the panel runs the model calls, consensus folds results into a verdict. An
unparseable artifact mirrors the Linter's engine — a single ``FAIL`` finding — but
in practice the CLI screens missing/empty input as an operational error (exit 2)
before reaching here, since the Judger only runs on a structural PASS.

The smoke/standard tiers' WARN-cap (``consensus.py``) bounds behavioral concerns
only. The unparseable-artifact ``FAIL`` above is a *structural* guard of the engine
itself, not a behavioral concern subject to that cap — it fires at every tier.
