"""Consensus — pure functions that fold a panel's results into a ``Verdict``.

Two stages:

1. **Map** every concern to a ``Finding`` capped at ``WARN``. This is why the
   default is advisory: smoke and standard tiers stop here, so ``WARN`` is the
   worst verdict they can emit — ``FAIL`` is unreachable *by construction*.
2. **Promote** (high-assurance tier only) the categories that clear a strict,
   cross-checked gate from ``WARN`` to ``FAIL``.

Every seat's concerns are recorded as findings — this is a UNION, not a
consolidation: an upheld arbiter concern that restates a peer's is corroboration
(multiple independent voices converging on the same defect), never deduplicated
away. The arbiter's adjudication only carries decision power at the high-assurance
FAIL gate (below); a dropped-by-the-arbiter concern still surfaces as an advisory
``WARN`` finding from its original reviewer, because no single voice may silence
the panel (see the Judger ADR, issue #57, §2.3).

Everything here is a pure function of the evaluators' results — no I/O, no model
vocabulary — mirroring the Linter's engine. All non-determinism lives in the
injected evaluator, never here.
